# sap-data-conversion-tools
This repository contains programs and tools for **SAP data conversion**.  
It includes multiple techniques for migrating, processing, and transforming data in SAP systems:

- **BDC (Batch Data Communication)** – Automates SAP transaction entry using recorded scripts.  
- **LSMW (Legacy System Migration Workbench)** – Facilitates mass data migration from legacy systems.  
- **BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface)** – Standard APIs for data operations.  
- **BAPI Extensions** – Custom enhancements to standard BAPIs for additional functionality.
